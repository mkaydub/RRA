# Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)
---

## Project Overview:

Incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### The Problem

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Running the Application

1. Open it [here](https://mkaydub.github.io/Restaurant-Reviews/)

#### Or

2. Download the .zip file or clone this repository
```
https://github.com/mkaydub/Restaurant-Reviews
```


* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
